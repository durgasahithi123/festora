    <h1>Varaha Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Varaha Purana is one of the eighteen major Puranas in Hinduism, associated primarily with Vaishnavism, as it glorifies Lord Vishnu's Varaha incarnation, the boar avatar who rescued the earth goddess Prithvi during a great flood.
       This Purana contains mythology focusing on the Varaha avatar but also includes chapters dedicated to Shiva and Shakti, reflecting a broad religious scope.<br>

      The Varaha Purana is considered a later Purana, likely composed between the 10th and 12th centuries CE, with ongoing revisions. 
         It combines religious stories, ethical instructions, tantric elements, and travelogue-like guides to sacred sites, providing a comprehensive religious and cultural manual for devotees .
      The Mahabharata and Ramayana are called "Itihasas" in Hindu tradition, which means "that which happened" or historical epics.
