    <h1>Bhagavata Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Bhagavata Purana is one of the most revered Hindu texts, detailing the avatars of Vishnu, especially Krishna,
      and emphasizing devotion (bhakti) as the path to liberation. It consists of twelve books and is central to Vaishnavism.<br>
      It bridges the three main paths to Moksha (liberation): Karma (ritual action), Jnana (knowledge), and Bhakti (devotion), but underscores Bhaktiâ€™s supremacy.
      
      Describes the ten core topics (Dasha Lakshana) typical of a major Purana: creation, subcreation, cosmology, the science of God, stories of avatars, liberation, and the ultimate goal of life.
      <br>
      Layered storytelling and philosophical exposition set it apart from other Purana texts.
