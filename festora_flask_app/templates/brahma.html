      It combines mythology with moral instruction, providing guidance on religious rituals, temple construction, and moral living.

      The text underscores the significance of devotion and moral conduct in achieving spiritual progress.

       It has played a notable role in shaping Hindu temple traditions, pilgrimage customs, and understanding of sacred geography.
