    <h1>Narada Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Narada Purana is a significant Hindu scripture belonging to the Purana genre, primarily focused on devotion (bhakti) to Lord Vishnu. It is traditionally presented as a dialogue involving sage Narada, emphasizing faith, religious rites, and spiritual teachings related to Vishnu worship.
      <br>
      The Purana strongly promotes Vaishnava doctrines and the path of surrender and devotion to Vishnu as the supreme means to salvation.

      Describes various Vaishnava feasts, ceremonies, and the significance of the Ekadashi fast dedicated to Vishnu.

        Contains stories of eminent devotees like Dhruva and Prahlad, emphasizing the power of devotion over worldly challenges.

        The second portion includes the legend of Mohini and King Rukmangada, highlighting moral dilemmas and sacrifices in devotion.
