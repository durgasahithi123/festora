    <h1>Vamana Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Vamana Purana is one of the eighteen major Puranas in Hinduism, traditionally attributed to the sage Vyasa.
       It is named after Lord Vishnu’s Vamana avatar (the dwarf incarnation). The text primarily focuses on the divine tales related to this incarnation but also includes stories of other deities such as Shiva and Durga, along with teachings on dharma (righteousness) and religious practices.<br>

The Purana contains around 5,800 verses structured in 26 chapters, though it is believed the original was longer and parts may be lost. 
It narrates stories about significant mythological figures and events such as the battle of the demon king Bali and the Vamana avatar’s three strides which reclaimed the universe for the gods.
 Other themes include creation, the origin of man, gods’ battles with demons, pilgrimage descriptions, and ethical teachings.
