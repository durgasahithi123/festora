    <h1>Kurma Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Kurma Purana is one of the eighteen Mahapuranas in Hinduism, named after the Kurma avatar, the tortoise incarnation of Lord Vishnu.
       It is a medieval-era text that combines Vaishnavism themes with extensive reverence for Shiva and Shakti, reflecting a balanced devotional outlook.<br>

The Purana includes legends, mythology, theology, pilgrimage (Tirtha) guides, cosmology, and a philosophical section called the Ishvara Gita, where Shiva imparts wisdom similar to the Bhagavad Gita.
 It discusses concepts like Atman (self), Brahman (ultimate reality), Maya (illusion), and Moksha (liberation) based on Advaita Vedanta philosophy.<br>

Structurally, it has two main partsâ€”Purvabhaga (earlier section) and Uttarabhaga (later section). 
It covers mythological tales, including the story of Indradyumna, the churning of the ocean (Samudra Manthana), descriptions of different Yugas (epochs), importance of sacred places like Varanasi and Prayag, duties of various life stages (ashramas), ethical and spiritual teachings, and rituals.<br>
