    <h1>Linga Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Linga Purana is one of the eighteen Mahapuranas, key Hindu religious texts devoted primarily to the worship and significance of the Shiva Linga, a symbolic representation of Lord Shiva. 
      The word "Linga" means "sign" or "symbol," and the Purana elaborates on this concept as both the manifested and unmanifested nature of the universe, with Shiva as the formless, changeless ultimate reality.<br>

The Linga Purana is divided into two parts: the longer Purva-bhaga (early section) and the shorter Uttara-bhaga (later section).
