    <h1>Agni Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Agni Purana is one of the eighteen major Puranas in Hinduism, consisting of approximately 12,000 to 15,000 verses across about 382 to 383 chapters. 
      It is a Sanskrit text named after Agni, the Hindu God of Fire, who is the narrator of the Purana to the sage Vashishtha.<br>
      The Agni Purana also recounts stories of Lord Vishnu's ten avatars and includes sections on the Ramayana and Mahabharata epics. 
      It is considered impartial towards various Hindu sects like Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism, and Smartism, containing elements related to all of them.
