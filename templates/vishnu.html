    <h1>Vishnu Purana</h1>
    <p class="book-desc">
      The Vishnu Purana is a foundational Hindu scripture focused on the glory, narratives, and cosmology of Lord Vishnu, particularly sacred to Vaishnava traditions.
      
      The Vishnu Purana presents its narratives through the Pancalaksana (five major themes): Sarga (creation), Pratisarga (re-creation), Vamsa (genealogy), Manvantara (cosmic cycles), Vamsanucaritam (kingly legends).<br>

      Vishnu is depicted as the supreme reality (Brahman), creator, preserver, and destroyer, manifesting in various forms and incarnations, especially Krishna.

      The text offers philosophical doctrines, cosmological explanations, genealogies, moral and ethical stories, and spiritual guidance, balancing mythology with practical teachings
